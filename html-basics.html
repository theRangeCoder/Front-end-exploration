        <h1> 
            My very first webpage!
        </h1>
        <h2> 
            This is my very first attempt at creating a website using HTML and I am quite excited to have begun this journey!
        </h2>
        <p> HTML is a markup language </p>
        <h2> They also use CSS </h2>
        <p> I am <strong> really </strong> excited to begin learning <em> CSS</em>! </p>

        <h2> The strong tag</h2>
        <p>The strong tag is used to put strong importance on a part of a text. For example: <strong>
            This part </strong> of the text has a strong emphasis on it.</p>

        <h2>The emphasis tag</h2>
        <p>The emphasis tag is used to lay stress on a certain part of a text. For example: <em> 
            This part</em> of the text has an emphasis on it.</p>
        
            <h2>Some interesting points on file naming and organization</h2>
        <p> The homepage should always be named <strong>index.html</strong>.</p>
        <p> The main folder of the website is known as the <strong>root folder</strong>. The <strong>
            index.html</strong> file should always be in the <strong>root folder</strong> but the other files
        can be in subfolders as well, depending on how one wishes to stay organized.</p>
        <p>Images should preferably be placed in a subfolder, to stay better organized.</p>
