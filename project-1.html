        <h1 style="color: darkblue; text-align: center;">Let's check out some interesting places to explore in Berlin!</h1>
        <p>Once referred to as "<strong>arm aber sexy</strong>" by a former mayor, Berlin has seen dynamic transformation since the last couple of years,
            and has managed to hold on to the "sexy" tag, that it was once associated with. Vibrant, edgy and artistic in its appeal, it
            is certainly one of the cities that has a place for everyone and not only artists. If you are confused as to which destination
            you should visit next, for a short vacation or a long stay, I would certainly recommend you to consider Berlin as one of your 
            options. Let us explore two interesting places that you should certainly check out, during your stay in Berlin.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(0,0,90);">1. Flohmarkt im Mauerpark (Flea market in Mauerpark)</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Every Sunday, Berliners can treat themselves at the flea market, which is organized at <strong>Mauerpark</strong> on a weekly basis. The 
            flea market contains a selection of used clothes and craftspeople. One can also find a good number of <em>street food stalls</em>,
            offering a wide variety of cuisines, to please the taste buds of visitors. For karaoke lovers as well as people who are
            willing to sing their hearts out, an <em>outdoor karaoke</em> session also awaits one, at the flea market.
