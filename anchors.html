        <h1>Anchors and attributes</h1>
        Before we commence this topic, if you are starting off your journey with HTML, I would encourage you to visit <a href="html-basics.html">this link</a>
        to brush up some basic syntax and file structure concepts in HTML.
        The <strong>anchor</strong> tags are used to create hyperlinks in an HTML document. Attributes (such as <strong>href</strong>)
         are used to embed the internal or external link that the hyperlink should redirect to. Attributes are placed in the opening anchor tags.
         Any external link should start with <strong>http://</strong> or <strong>https://</strong>.

         <h2>Different types of paths:</h2>
         <p>1. <strong>Absolute paths:</strong> These refer to linking your website to external websites/ images. </p>
         <p>2. <strong>Relative paths:</strong> These refer to linking pages/ images within your own website, such as linking
        the homepage to the 'About us' page of the same website. This can simply be done by putting the file name (with the path, if the 
    file is in a subfolder) along with the attribute keyword.</p>
